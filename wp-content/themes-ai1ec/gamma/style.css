	= New theme structure in All-in-One Event Calendar 1.9 =
	========================================================

	As of 1.9, please do not place your custom CSS rules in this file. Instead,
	place them in here:

	  [wp_root]/themes-ai1ec/[your_theme_directory]/css/override.css

	Alternatively, for the more savvy designers, use the dynamic LESS stylesheet
	language (http://lesscss.org/) to define your style rules, allowing you to
	take advantage of any LESS variables defined by Vortex (see
	[wp_root]/themes-ai1ec/vortex/less/user_variables.php). Place your LESS code
	in this file:

	  [wp_root]/themes-ai1ec/[your_theme_directory]/less/override.less

	The style rules produced by these files will be applied *after* all the
	default style rules of Vortex have been applied.

	= NOTE ======================================================================
	= Be sure to visit Events > Theme Options and click "Save Options" any time =
	= you make changes to either of the above files before viewing your site.   =
